untitled terminal game
--
as the name suggests, this project is a game that does not yet have a name, and will be played fully through the terminal. im using this project as a way of furthering my knowledge on general game development concepts, but also OOP and pyhton in general.

the end goal in mind is way above my current skill, so development will be extremely slow!! i would really love some aid in this project so if you feel as though you could help in anyway please reach out!

here are a few things in mind for this project:
- all assets (e.g. player model, level design), will be made in ASCII art.
- the terminal's screen position will be manipulated and will at several times be moved.
- several instances of the terminal will be created which all link to the main terminal.

there's a lot to get done, so for anyone watching this project stay tuned!
